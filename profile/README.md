## TurnKey Linux Compatibility

KVMDash works seamlessly with [TurnKey Linux](http://mirror.turnkeylinux.org/turnkeylinux/images/iso/) images. With TurnKey Linux, you get access to over 100 pre-built, ready-to-use server appliances based on Debian.

### Integration Benefits:
- **Rapid Deployment:** Immediately ready-to-use specialized servers without complex configuration.
- **Wide Range:** From web server stacks (LAMP, LEMP) to CMS (WordPress, Drupal) and collaboration tools.
- **Security:** Regularly updated, hardened images with automatic security updates.

### Using TurnKey Images in KVMDash:
1. Download the desired TurnKey image from the official website.
2. Import the image into KVMDash as a VM template.
3. Create new VMs based on these templates with just a few clicks.

TurnKey images provide an ideal complement to KVMDash for quickly deploying productive server environments without having to perform complex manual configurations.
